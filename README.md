A comprehensive dataset of rice field weed detection from Bangladesh
Abstract: 
In agricultural research, particularly concerning rice cultivation, the presence of weeds within rice fields is acknowledged as a significant contributor to both diminished crop quality and increased production costs. 
Rice fields, due to their inherently moist environment, offer ideal conditions for weed proliferation. Traditionally, the control of these weeds has been managed through labor-intensive manual methods. 
However, as the agricultural sector evolves, there is a notable pivot towards leveraging advanced technological solutions, including deep learning and machine learning. The efficacy of these technologies hinges on the availability of high-quality, relevant data.
To address this, a comprehensive dataset comprising 3632 high-resolution RGB images has been developed. This dataset is designed to capture a diverse range of weed species, specifically 11 types that are frequently found in rice fields.
The diversity of the dataset ensures that machine learning models trained using this data can effectively identify and differentiate between desired and undesired plant species. 
While the dataset predominantly includes images from Bangladesh, the weed species it documents are commonly found across various global rice-growing regions, enhancing the dataset's applicability in different agricultural settings.

Data Description:
The rice field weeds dataset is a collection of standard images, comprising 3632 pictures of 11 types of weeds found in various rice fields in Bangladesh. These 11 weeds were identified through field research and consultation with local agricultural officials. 
After that, 11 different types were titled after the scientific name of the weeds. 
Table 1- shows the types of rice weeds those image data are collected
